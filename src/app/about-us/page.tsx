          When Fr Ken Barker MGL was in Assisi in the Jubilee Year 2000 praying
          in the small church where St Francis and his brothers spent much of
          their time, he sensed the Lord wanted a movement of young men in
          Australia, which would spread also to other countries. He sensed the
          Lord wanted young men to rise up in the Church today with a deep
          faith, purity of heart, and strength of character, to become leaders
          for the future. The Lord wanted to help young men to change; to know
          they can be made new. Fr Ken shared this vision with some young men in
          Canberra who had already begun to gather with other young men to
          support one another around, sport, teachings, and personal sharing.
          They shared the vision together and a movement was born. During Covid,
          and due to other influences, the movement lost momentum. We are now in
          a moment of renaissance with renewed vision and vigour to fulfill the
          Lordâ€™s dream for men. This renewal has been assisted by a strong group
          of young men in Adelaide led by Charl Abd elmalk who in 2024 decided
          to change their original name and come into communion with YMG.
